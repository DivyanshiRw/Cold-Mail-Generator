# Cold-Mail-Generator

This project is a cold email generation tool that leverages the power of LLaMA 3.3, a language model, to generate personalized cold emails based on job postings and skills. The system uses the provided job posting link and matches it with portfolio and skills (stored in a CSV file) to create a professional cold email.

## Features
### Job Posting Integration:
The tool takes a link to a job posting and generates a customized cold email.
### Skills & Portfolio Matching:
It uses a CSV file containing skills and portfolio to personalize the email content.
### LLaMA 3.3 Model:
The cold emails are generated using the LLaMA 3.3 model to ensure the content is relevant, well-written, and professional.

 The API key provided via Groq is used to access the LLaMA 3.3 model for the generation.
