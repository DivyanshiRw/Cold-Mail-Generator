Specific team norms around working hours will be communicated by your manager. Interns should not have conflicts such as class or other employment during the Amazon work-day. Applicants should have a minimum of one quarter/semester/trimester remaining in their studies after their internship concludes. Applicants will be considered for SDE roles including the Amazon Propel Program (APP) through this application. We will take your internship season and location preferences into consideration. Preferences are based on business availability and are not guaranteed. Please note that a majority of our internships take place in the summer. Start dates for our internships include the following periods: 1. Summer (Starts May/June) – SDE and APP 2. Fall (Starts August/September) – SDE only Amazon Propel Program (APP) Internships The Amazon Propel Program internship seeks to support candidates from historically underrepresented groups in the tech industry by providing skill and experience-based development opportunities. Software Development Engineer (SDE) Internships At Amazon, we hire the best minds in technology to innovate and build on behalf of our customers.
